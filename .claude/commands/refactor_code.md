# Code Refactoring Guide

I'll help you refactor code by applying established software engineering principles, design patterns, and best practices from highly regarded literature and academic research. The refactoring will adapt the code to follow idioms and conventions specific to $1 or the detected language if no target language is specified.

## Refactoring Process

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Identify code smells using Martin Fowler's classification
   - Assess current design patterns and architectural approach
   - Evaluate complexity using metrics (cyclomatic complexity, coupling, cohesion)
   - Detect potential technical debt indicators

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Select appropriate refactoring techniques from Fowler's catalog
   - Identify applicable design patterns from GoF or modern equivalents
   - Consider enterprise patterns and domain-driven design principles where appropriate
   - Determine language-specific idioms and best practices to apply
   - Plan refactoring sequence to maintain behavior while transforming structure

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Apply refactoring transformations systematically
   - Incorporate language-specific idioms and conventions
   - Implement selected design patterns where appropriate
   - Improve naming, comments, and documentation

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Ensure behavior preservation (suggest tests if absent)
   - Verify adherence to SOLID principles
   - Confirm improved readability and maintainability
   - Validate language-specific best practices

## Principles Applied

- **SOLID Principles** (Robert C. Martin)
  - Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion

- **Clean Code Practices** (Robert C. Martin)
  - Meaningful names, small functions, DRY principle, comment purposefully

- **Design Patterns** (Gang of Four + Modern Patterns)
  - Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns as appropriate

- **Enterprise Application Patterns** (Martin Fowler)
  - Domain Logic patterns (Domain Model, Transaction Script)
  - Data Source Architectural patterns (Table Data Gateway, Active Record, Data Mapper)
  - Object-Relational Behavioral/Structural patterns (Identity Map, Unit of Work, Lazy Load)
  - Web Presentation patterns (MVC, Front Controller, Template View)

- **Domain-Driven Design Principles** (Eric Evans)
  - Ubiquitous Language and Bounded Contexts
  - Strategic Design with Context Maps
  - Tactical Design with Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects
  - Domain Events and Event Sourcing

- **Code Quality Metrics**
  - Reduced complexity, improved cohesion, decreased coupling
  - Language-specific performance considerations

- **Technical Debt Reduction** (Ward Cunningham concept)
  - Identifying and addressing deliberate and inadvertent technical debt

## Language-Specific Considerations

I'll adapt the refactoring to follow $1-specific (or detected language) idioms, including:

- Language-specific design patterns
- Standard library utilization
- Performance optimizations
- Community-established conventions
- Modern language features

Let me analyze your code and provide a comprehensive refactoring that preserves behavior while improving design, readability, and maintainability according to established principles and $1-specific best practices.
