# Test Planner

I'll analyze your code changes through the lens of the test pyramid and principles from Effective Software Testing. I'll create a comprehensive testing plan focusing on:

1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. End-to-end tests
4. Property-based tests
5. Mutation testing

## Analysis Process

I will:

1. Identify portions of the project that need testing based on your description or uncommitted changes
2. Create a testing plan focused on critical paths and edge cases
3. Document the plan in TODO.md for future reference
4. Begin implementing the tests following best practices

## Effective Testing Principles

I'll apply these key principles:
- Risk-based testing prioritization
- Boundary value analysis
- Input space partitioning
- Test doubles (mocks, stubs) where appropriate
- Coverage analysis (branch, statement, path)

Let me analyze your changes and create a comprehensive testing strategy that ensures your code is robust and reliable.
