# Emergency Incident Response

Use the jira-project-manager agent to handle production issues with appropriate urgency and documentation.

## Task

I need help with an incident/emergency: $*

## Requirements

Use the @task jira-project-manager agent to:
1. Create Bug tickets with:
   - Appropriate severity and priority levels
   - Immediate impact assessment
   - Affected user groups and systems
   - Timeline of the incident
2. Plan for both:
   - Short-term fixes (immediate mitigation)
   - Long-term preventive solutions (root cause)
3. Coordinate with established incident response procedures
4. Link to relevant monitoring, logs, and post-mortem documentation

## Context

Emergency response requires:
- Clear, concise problem description
- Immediate actionability for the team
