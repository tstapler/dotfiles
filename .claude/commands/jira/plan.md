# Project Planning and Organization

Use the jira-project-manager agent to break down large features into manageable, well-structured work items.

## Task

I need help planning and organizing: $*

## Requirements

Use the @task jira-project-manager agent to:
1. Break down complex features into proper hierarchy:
   - Features → Epics → Stories/Tasks/Bugs → Sub-tasks
2. Apply INVEST principles to ensure each story is:
   - Independent (can be developed in isolation)
   - Negotiable (allows for discussion)
   - Valuable (clear business value)
   - Estimable (sufficient detail for estimation)
   - Small (completable within a sprint)
   - Testable (clear acceptance criteria)
3. Identify and manage relationships through proper linking
4. Ensure appropriate sizing for sprint planning

## Context

Complex project organization for FBG requires:
- Strict hierarchy compliance
- Clear story independence within Epic boundaries
- Proper use of dependencies and issue links
- Alignment with team capacity and business priorities
