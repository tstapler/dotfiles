## Requirements

Use the @task jira-project-manager agent to:
1. Analyze the requirements and apply INVEST principles
2. Ensure strict hierarchy compliance (Features → Epics → Stories → Sub-tasks)
3. Create properly formatted tickets with:
   - Clear problem/requirement-focused descriptions
   - Comprehensive acceptance criteria in dedicated fields
   - Appropriate labels (including "TylerBot" tag)
   - Proper Jira formatting with escaped code blocks
   - All required custom fields

## Context

This is for FBG work, so maintain:
- Zero tolerance for hierarchy violations
- 100% compliance with formatting standards
- Complete INVEST criteria validation
- Professional quality that reflects FBG standards
