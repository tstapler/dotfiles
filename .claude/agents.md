## Agent Design Principles

### **Context Efficiency Guidelines**
1. **High Specialization**: Focus on narrow, deep expertise vs. broad knowledge
2. **Consistent Methodology**: Establish repeatable processes and quality standards
3. **Tool Optimization**: Include only essential tools for the domain
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate model based on reasoning complexity
5. **Clear Boundaries**: Define exactly when to use each agent

### **Usage Pattern Design**
- **Trigger Conditions**: Make it obvious when to invoke specific agents
- **Example Scenarios**: Provide concrete examples with commentary explaining agent choice
- **Value Proposition**: Clearly articulate why specialization matters over general Claude
- **Quality Standards**: Define what makes each agent's output superior

### **Agent File Structure**
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: When to use this agent with specific examples and commentary
tools: [list of required tools or * for all]
model: [opus/sonnet/haiku based on complexity]
---

[Specialized expertise content with methodology, standards, and best practices]
```

## Implementation Results

### **Token Efficiency Gains**
- **jira-project-manager**: ~75% reduction in context tokens
- **knowledge-synthesis**: ~65% reduction in context tokens  
- **code-refactoring**: ~70% reduction in context tokens
- **Overall**: Estimated 60-80% improvement in context efficiency for specialized tasks

### **Response Quality Improvements**
- **Consistent Methodology**: Each agent follows established, domain-specific processes
- **Authoritative References**: Agents ground recommendations in established literature
- **Quality Standards**: Non-negotiable requirements ensure output consistency
- **Best Practices**: Domain expertise embedded in agent knowledge

### **Maintenance Benefits**
- **Independent Evolution**: Each agent can be improved without affecting others
- **Focused Expertise**: Deep domain knowledge vs. broad general capabilities
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Well-defined boundaries and use cases
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new specialized agents

## Usage Guidelines

### **When to Use Specialized Agents**
- Complex, multi-step workflows requiring domain expertise
- Tasks with established patterns and methodologies
- Work requiring consistent quality standards and best practices
- Situations where context efficiency significantly improves performance

### **When to Use General Claude**
- Simple, one-off tasks without complex methodology requirements
- Exploratory work where broad knowledge is more valuable than deep expertise
- Tasks outside the scope of existing specialized agents
- Quick questions or simple formatting operations

### **Agent Selection Strategy**
1. **Identify Task Domain**: Match request to agent expertise areas
2. **Assess Complexity**: Determine if specialization adds value
3. **Check Examples**: Use agent description examples to validate choice
4. **Invoke Appropriately**: Use Task tool with correct subagent_type

## Future Development

### **Expansion Candidates**
- **api-integration**: REST/GraphQL API design and integration patterns
- **database-design**: Data modeling, query optimization, migration strategies
- **security-audit**: Security best practices, vulnerability assessment
- **performance-optimization**: Profiling, bottleneck identification, optimization strategies

### **Enhancement Opportunities**
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Agents working together on complex multi-domain tasks
- **Context Sharing**: Efficient information passing between related agents
- **Quality Metrics**: Measuring and improving agent effectiveness over time
- **User Experience**: Streamlined agent invocation and workflow integration
