# Resume ATS Optimizer

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Optimize their resume for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Check if their resume will pass automated screening
- Understand why their applications aren't getting responses
- Mentions keywords like: "ATS", "not getting interviews", "resume not working", "optimize resume", "keyword optimization"

Also use when the user provides a resume file and mentions they're applying to jobs.

## Core Capabilities

- Parse resume and test ATS compatibility
- Extract and analyze keywords against job descriptions
- Identify formatting issues that break ATS parsers
- Calculate match scores between resume and job postings
- Suggest keyword additions and placements
- Generate ATS-friendly formatting recommendations

## The ATS Problem

75% of resumes are rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems before a human ever sees them. Companies use ATS to:
- Filter out unqualified candidates automatically
- Search for specific keywords from job requirements
- Parse resumes into structured data
- Rank candidates by keyword match percentage

Common reasons resumes fail ATS:
1. Poor formatting (tables, columns, headers/footers)
2. Missing keywords from job description
3. Inconsistent section headers
4. Non-standard fonts or special characters
5. Text embedded in images
6. Incorrect file format

## ATS Compatibility Checklist

### File Format
- ✅ Use .docx or .pdf (not .pages, .odt)
- ✅ PDF must be text-based, not scanned image
- ✅ File name: "FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf"

### Font & Formatting
- ✅ Standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Georgia, Times New Roman
- ✅ Font size: 10-12pt for body, 14-16pt for headers
- ✅ No text boxes, tables, or columns
- ✅ No headers/footers (put contact info in body)
- ✅ No images, graphics, or charts
- ✅ Consistent date formats (MM/YYYY)
- ✅ Standard bullet points (•, -, *)

### Section Headers
Use standard, recognizable headers:
- ✅ "Professional Experience" or "Work Experience" (not "Where I've Been")
- ✅ "Education" (not "Academic Background")
- ✅ "Skills" (not "Core Competencies")
- ✅ "Summary" or "Professional Summary"

### Contact Information
```
John Smith
email@example.com | (555) 123-4567 | LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/johnsmith
San Francisco, CA
```

NOT in header/footer, and avoid:
- ❌ Tables for contact info
- ❌ Special characters in email
- ❌ Multiple phone numbers
- ❌ Full mailing address (city/state is enough)

## Keyword Optimization Process

### Step 1: Extract Job Description Keywords

Identify three types of keywords:

**Hard Skills (Technical)**
- Programming languages (Python, Java, SQL)
- Tools and platforms (Salesforce, AWS, Excel)
- Certifications (PMP, CPA, CFA)
- Methodologies (Agile, Six Sigma, SDLC)

**Soft Skills**
- Leadership, collaboration, communication
- Problem-solving, analytical thinking
- Project management, stakeholder management

**Industry Terms**
- B2B, SaaS, e-commerce
- Enterprise, SMB, mid-market
- ARR, MRR, churn rate

### Step 2: Match Analysis

For each keyword in job description:
1. Check if exact phrase appears in resume
2. Check for synonyms or variations
3. Count frequency of mention
4. Note location (summary, experience, skills)

### Step 3: Calculate Match Score

```
Match Score = (Keywords Matched / Total Required Keywords) × 100

Example:
Job has 20 required keywords
Your resume has 15 of them
Match Score = 75%

Target: 80%+ for strong match
```

### Step 4: Keyword Placement Strategy

**Priority 1: Professional Summary (Top of Resume)**
- Include 5-8 most important keywords
- Use naturally in 3-4 sentence paragraph
- Example: "Data Scientist with 5+ years using Python, SQL, and machine learning to drive business insights..."

**Priority 2: Skills Section**
- List keywords explicitly
- Group by category if needed
- Use exact phrasing from job description

**Priority 3: Experience Bullets**
- Incorporate keywords into achievement statements
- Don't force keywords unnaturally
- Use variations throughout

**Keyword Density Guidelines:**
- Critical keywords: Appear 2-4 times throughout resume
- Important keywords: Appear 1-2 times
- Don't keyword stuff - keep it natural
- Vary phrasing (e.g., "led team" and "team leadership")

## Analysis Output Format

When analyzing a resume, provide this structured report:

```markdown
# ATS COMPATIBILITY REPORT

## Overall Score: [X]/100

### File Format Check ✅/❌
- Format: [DOCX/PDF]
- Text extraction: [Success/Failed]
- File size: [X KB/MB]

### Formatting Issues
✅ No tables or columns detected
❌ Contact info in header (move to body)
⚠️  Two different font sizes in skills section

### Keyword Analysis

JOB REQUIREMENTS vs YOUR RESUME:

**Critical Keywords (Must Have):**
✅ Project Management - Found 3x
✅ Agile/Scrum - Found 2x
❌ Stakeholder Management - MISSING (mentioned 5x in JD)
❌ Budget Management - MISSING (mentioned 3x in JD)

**Important Keywords:**
✅ Cross-functional teams - Found 1x
⚠️  "Risk management" - You have "risk mitigation" (close but not exact match)
✅ Process improvement - Found 2x

**Match Score: 65%**
Target: 80%+ recommended

### Recommended Changes

**1. Add Missing Keywords:**

In Professional Summary, change:
"Experienced project manager with proven track record..."

To:
"Experienced project manager with proven track record in stakeholder management and budget oversight..."

In Experience section, add bullet:
"Managed stakeholder communication across 3 departments and executive leadership team"
"Directed budget management for $2.5M project portfolio"

**2. Fix Formatting:**
- Move contact information from header to body of resume
- Make all skill section items same font size (currently 10pt and 11pt mixed)

**3. Strengthen Existing Keywords:**
Change "risk mitigation" to "risk management" for exact match

### Estimated New Match Score: 85%

## Common ATS Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Creative Formatting
```
❌ PROBLEM:
[Two-column layout with graphics]
[Skill bars and proficiency charts]
[Text in colored boxes]

✅ SOLUTION:
- Single column layout
- Text-only skills list
- Simple bullet points
```

### Pattern 2: Unconventional Section Names
```
❌ PROBLEM:
"My Journey" (instead of Experience)
"What I Bring to the Table" (instead of Skills)
"Academic Pursuits" (instead of Education)

✅ SOLUTION:
Use standard headers ATS recognizes
```

### Pattern 3: Missing Keywords
```
❌ PROBLEM:
Job requires: "Python, SQL, Data Visualization"
Resume says: "Programming, databases, making charts"

✅ SOLUTION:
Use exact terminology from job description
```

### Pattern 4: Keyword Stuffing
```
❌ PROBLEM:
Skills: Python, Python programming, Python developer, Python expert, Python specialist, Advanced Python...

✅ SOLUTION:
Skills: Python, SQL, JavaScript, React, Node.js
(Then incorporate naturally in bullets)
```

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### Tech Resumes
- Emphasize programming languages and frameworks
- Include GitHub, portfolio links in Skills section (not header)
- Certifications and courses matter highly

### Business/Finance
- Focus on software proficiency (Excel, SAP, Salesforce)
- Certifications critical (CPA, CFA, PMP)
- Industry keywords (P&L, ROI, KPI)

### Healthcare
- Licenses and certifications required
- Specific systems (Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH)
- Compliance keywords (HIPAA, Joint Commission)

### Marketing
- Platform expertise (HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Analytics)
- Channel keywords (SEO, PPC, email marketing)
- Metrics and results-driven language

## Edge Cases & Special Situations

### Career Changers
- Focus on transferable skills
- Use keywords from TARGET industry, not just current
- May need two resume versions for ATS

### Recent Graduates
- Education section becomes priority for keywords
- Include relevant coursework, projects
- Internships count as experience - use those keywords

### Executive Level
- ATS still matters for senior roles
- Focus on strategic keywords
- Include board experience, P&L size, team size

### Gaps in Employment
- Use years only (not months) if it helps
- Include freelance/consulting with keywords
- Volunteer work can include relevant keywords

## Implementation Checklist

When helping user optimize for ATS:

1. ✅ Scan current resume for ATS compatibility issues
2. ✅ Analyze job description for required keywords
3. ✅ Calculate current match score
4. ✅ Identify specific missing keywords
5. ✅ Suggest exact placements for new keywords
6. ✅ Flag formatting problems
7. ✅ Provide before/after examples
8. ✅ Re-score after suggested changes
9. ✅ Verify file format and naming
10. ✅ Test with ATS simulator if possible

## Success Metrics

After optimization, the resume should:
- Score 80%+ match for target job descriptions
- Pass ATS parsing test (all sections recognized)
- Have zero formatting errors
- Include all critical keywords 2-4x each
- Read naturally (not keyword-stuffed)
- Be ready to submit immediately
