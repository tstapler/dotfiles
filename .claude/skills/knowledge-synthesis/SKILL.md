# Knowledge Synthesis

Synthesize knowledge from multiple sources into interconnected Zettelkasten notes.

## When to Use This Skill

**Complex topics requiring**:
- Multi-source research (3+ authoritative sources)
- Academic literature integration
- Book zettels with author information
- Systematic concept mapping
- Both supporting and contradicting perspectives

**Simple topics** (single source, straightforward): Handle directly without full workflow

## Core Workflow

### 1. Research Phase

- Search multiple source types (academic, books, authoritative sites)
- Find foundational works and key authors
- Identify supporting AND contradicting evidence
- Cross-reference across sources

### 2. Synthesis Phase

- Create main page with comprehensive coverage
- Create supporting pages for related concepts
- Create book zettels for referenced works
- Integrate with existing knowledge network

### 3. Integration Phase

- Update journal with synthesis summary
- Link to related existing pages
- Ensure bidirectional connections

## Zettelkasten Structure

Every note should include:

1. **Core Definition** - Brief, clear explanation
2. **Background/Context** - Origins, key figures
3. **Key Characteristics** - Essential features
4. **Applications/Usage** - Use cases
5. **Related Concepts** - `[[links]]` to other concepts
6. **Significance** - Why it matters
7. **Related Topics** - `#[[Tag1]] #[[Tag2]]`

## Linking Strategy

| Type | Format | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| People | `[[Name]]` | `[[Alan Turing]]` |
| Concepts | `[[Concept]]` | `[[Machine Learning]]` |
| Technologies | `[[Tech]]` | `[[Kubernetes]]` |
| Tags | `#[[Tag]]` | `#[[Computer Science]]` |

## Tagging Guidelines

Use 3-7 tags per note:
- **Disciplinary**: `#[[Computer Science]]`, `#[[Philosophy]]`
- **Methodological**: `#[[Design Patterns]]`, `#[[Best Practices]]`
- **Categorical**: `#[[Tools]]`, `#[[Concepts]]`, `#[[Theories]]`
- **Contextual**: `#[[Business]]`, `#[[Open Source]]`

## Quality Standards

- Accurate attribution with source URLs
- Meaningful bidirectional links (not link spam)
- Multi-source validation for complex topics
- Both supporting and critical perspectives
- Comprehensive coverage of major aspects

## File Locations

- **Pages**: `/logseq/pages/*.md`
- **Journals**: `/logseq/journals/YYYY_MM_DD.md`

## Book Zettel Template

For referenced books, create dedicated pages:
- Title as page name
- Author with credentials
- Key concepts covered
- Cross-references to related concepts
- Tags: `#[[Books]]`, `#[[Authors]]`
