# Job Description Analyzer

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Wants to analyze a job posting
- Asks "should I apply to this job?"
- Wants to know their match percentage for a role
- Needs help understanding job requirements
- Wants to tailor their resume for a specific position
- Mentions: "analyze this job", "am I qualified", "match score", "should I apply"

Use this BEFORE resume tailoring to ensure effort is worth it.

## Core Capabilities

- Extract and categorize job requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Calculate match score between user's experience and job requirements
- Identify skill gaps and strengths
- Detect red flags in job postings
- Prioritize which experiences to highlight
- Generate resume tailoring strategy
- Create cover letter talking points
- Assess company culture fit indicators

## The Strategic Problem

Most job seekers waste time on:
- Jobs they're under-qualified for (<60% match)
- Jobs they're over-qualified for (flight risk)
- Jobs with red flags (high turnover, toxic culture)
- Applying to 50+ jobs blindly hoping something sticks

Better approach:
- Apply to 10-15 jobs strategically
- Target 70-90% match jobs
- Customize deeply for each
- Higher response rate, less burnout

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Extract Requirements

Break job description into categories:

**Required (Must-Have)**
- Education requirements
- Years of experience
- Specific technical skills
- Certifications/licenses
- Industry experience

**Preferred (Nice-to-Have)**
- "Bonus" skills
- Advanced certifications
- Domain expertise
- Specific tool experience

**Soft Skills/Culture**
- Communication style
- Work environment
- Team structure
- Company values

### Step 2: Keyword Extraction

Identify three types:

**Hard Skills** (Technical abilities)
- Tools: Salesforce, Python, AWS, Excel
- Methodologies: Agile, Six Sigma, SDLC
- Certifications: PMP, CPA, AWS Certified

**Soft Skills** (Interpersonal)
- Leadership, collaboration, communication
- Problem-solving, critical thinking
- Adaptability, initiative

**Industry/Domain Knowledge**
- B2B SaaS, healthcare, fintech
- Enterprise vs SMB
- Regulatory knowledge (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR)

### Step 3: Calculate Match Score

```
MATCH CALCULATION:

Required Skills:
- User has 8 out of 10 required = 80%

Preferred Skills:
- User has 3 out of 5 preferred = 60%

Overall Match:
- Weight required 70%, preferred 30%
- (80% × 0.7) + (60% × 0.3) = 74%

INTERPRETATION:
90-100% = Overqualified (may be flight risk)
75-89% = Excellent fit (apply immediately)
60-74% = Good fit (apply with strong cover letter)
50-59% = Stretch role (apply if passionate)
<50% = Under-qualified (skip unless dream job)
```

### Step 4: Gap Analysis

For each missing requirement:
- **Critical gap**: Deal-breaker (don't apply)
- **Major gap**: Significant but addressable (mention in cover letter)
- **Minor gap**: Easy to learn (downplay or emphasize related skills)

### Step 5: Red Flag Detection

Scan for warning signs:

**Workload Red Flags:**
- "Wear many hats"
- "Fast-paced environment"
- "Hit the ground running"
- "Self-starter in ambiguous situations"

**Culture Red Flags:**
- "Rockstar/Ninja/Guru"
- "We work hard, play hard"
- "Unlimited vacation"
- "Like a family"

**Compensation Red Flags:**
- "Competitive salary" (won't tell you range)
- "Equity-heavy" (low cash compensation)
- "Commission-based" (no base salary)
- "DOE" with no range
