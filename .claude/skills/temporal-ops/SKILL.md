# Skill: temporal-ops

## Overview

This skill operates and diagnoses Temporal environments. It has two modes:

- **Operations:** the user wants to do something — create a namespace, rotate a key, check capacity, find unhealthy workflows, cancel a batch, set up export. The skill executes the right commands and interprets the output.
- **Diagnosis:** the user arrives with a symptom — a stuck workflow, a cert error, a connection timeout, a non-determinism panic. The skill routes the investigation through a layered, bottom-up diagnosis until a root cause is identified with a confidence score.

It does not teach how to write workflows or activities (use `skill-temporal-developer` for that), and it does not reproduce exhaustive CLI flag tables — run `temporal <cmd> --help` for those, and see [cli-conventions.md](references/ops/cli-conventions.md) for cross-command CLI conventions. The boundary is: if the user needs to administer or troubleshoot a running Temporal environment, this skill applies.

## Out of scope

- **Writing workflows, activities, or SDK code** → `skill-temporal-developer`.
- **Exhaustive CLI flags / command reference** → run `temporal <cmd> --help`; **cross-command CLI conventions** → [cli-conventions.md](references/ops/cli-conventions.md).
- **Worker performance tuning, sizing, capacity planning** → `skill-temporal-workertuning`.
- **Helm, Kubernetes, database admin, monitoring stack config** for self-hosted — beyond the CLI surface.

If the conversation drifts into one of these areas, hand off to the relevant sibling skill rather than improvising.

## Philosophy

### Operator discipline

When the user wants to perform an operational task:

1. **Identify the intent and backend.** Is this a Cloud operation (`tcld`) or a self-hosted operation (`temporal operator`)? Data-plane operations (`temporal workflow`, `temporal batch`, etc.) work on both. **If the backend is ambiguous, ask before proceeding — do not assume Cloud or self-hosted and do not output environment-specific commands until you know.**
2. **Execute commands and interpret output.** Run the documented command, read the result, and report what it means — or act on it if the user asked for an action. Read-only commands (`get`, `list`, `describe`, `count`, `show`) run freely. Anything listed under [Destructive operations](#destructive-operations) is proposed to the user first.
3. **Verify the result.** After a mutating operation, confirm the new state matches the user's intent.

### Destructive operations

An operation belongs to this tier if it is **irreversible** (`tcld namespace
delete`), **revokes access for a live identity** (`tcld apikey delete`), **moves
production traffic** (`tcld namespace failover`), or **fans out to every match**
(any `--query` form). Apply the test to the operation in front of you — this is a
rule, not a list, and a command's absence from any list in this skill does not
place it outside the tier.

For anything in the tier: gather the evidence and **propose**. Do not run it on
your own initiative, and do not run one to find out what it would do. The
reference file for each command states its specific blast radius; read that
before proposing, not after.

1. **Blast radius as a number, not a description.** For any `--query` form, run
   `temporal workflow count --query '<query>'` with the byte-identical query
   first and carry the result into the proposal. A filter with no narrowing
   predicate beyond `ExecutionStatus="Running"` matches every open Execution in
   the Namespace.
2. **Name the target.** State the exact command, the target, and the Namespace it
   resolves to. Connection settings can come from `TEMPORAL_*` env vars or a
   config-file profile, so the target is frequently not visible in the command
   text. If the backend or Namespace was inferred from context rather than stated
   by the user, say so — a destructive command aimed at the wrong Namespace is the
   most common way this goes wrong.
3. **Ask explicitly, then run it so it completes.** Put the command, the target,
   and — for any `--query` form — the count from step 1 to the user as a direct
   question, and wait for an answer. Once they approve, run it with `--yes` on the
   `--query` batch forms; that flag is what lets an approved batch finish, since
   the interactive prompt needs a terminal and without one the command reports
   `user denied confirmation` and does nothing. `--yes` belongs in a command the
   user approved, never in a retry of one that failed its prompt. Do not substitute
   a loop over single-target `workflow terminate --workflow-id`. Approval covers one
   command against one target; it does not carry to the next command, a widened
   query, or a second Namespace.
4. **Verify, and know the abort path.** Re-run the corresponding `get`,
   `describe`, or `count`. A batch job drains asynchronously:
   `temporal batch describe --job-id <id>` shows how far it has gotten and
   `temporal batch terminate --job-id <id>` stops it before it reaches the rest
   of its matches.

When a reversible sibling reaches the same goal, propose it alongside: `cancel`
lets Workflow cleanup code run where `terminate` does not; `apikey disable` is
reversible where `delete` is not; `accepted-client-ca add` appends where `set`
replaces.

Assume nothing in the environment will stop a destructive command on your behalf.
Credential scope, command denylists, and confirmation prompts may or may not be
configured, and their possible presence is not a reason to skip any step above —
you are the safeguard the user is relying on.

### Diagnostic discipline

When the user arrives with a failure or anomaly:

1. **Bottom-up diagnosis.** Verify the lower layer before blaming the upper one. The layers, from bottom to top:
   1. DNS / network path
   2. TCP / port reachability
   3. TLS handshake
   4. Authentication (API key or mTLS client cert)
   5. gRPC health and Temporal frontend reachability
   6. Temporal namespace, task queues, workers
   7. Workflow code (determinism, signals, timers, child workflows)

   The full ladder lives in [diagnostic-ladder.md](references/triage/diagnostic-ladder.md).

2. **Always verify the next layer up** rather than prescribing a speculative fix. If TLS works, prove auth works before blaming the workflow. If pollers are present, prove the workflow's last event before blaming the worker.

3. **Attach a confidence score** (1-10) to every proposed diagnosis:
   - 9-10: symptoms, operation, and confirming signals line up cleanly.
   - 6-8: evidence is good but at least one alternative remains plausible.
   - 1-5: the issue is still ambiguous; the "fix" is the next discriminating check, not a root cause.

4. **Name ambiguity explicitly.** Errors like `context deadline exceeded` are not self-describing, and a single code such as `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` can mean more than one condition (account-limit throttling vs. per-Workflow lock contention). Surface that, gather more context, and scope the next step narrowly.

These are skill conventions, not docs-derived facts.

## The process

### Operations path

#### Step 1: Identify intent and backend

Determine what the user wants to do and whether it targets:
- **Temporal Cloud** → use `tcld` commands (requires `tcld login`)
- **Self-hosted cluster** → use `temporal operator` commands
- **Data plane (either backend)** → use `temporal workflow`, `temporal batch`, `temporal schedule`, etc.

If the backend is unambiguous from context — `.tmprl.cloud` address, `tcld` command, Cloud namespace format `ns.account` → Cloud; Kubernetes/Helm, `docker-compose`, self-hosted config files → self-hosted — proceed without asking. **Otherwise, stop and ask: "Are you on Temporal Cloud or self-hosted?" before outputting any environment-specific commands.** Do not default to either environment. Once known, save the answer to memory so you don't ask again in future conversations.

#### Step 2: Execute and interpret

Look up the intent in the Operations table above. Read the linked reference file for the exact commands, flags, and expected output. Run the command and interpret the result for the user.

#### Step 3: Verify

After a mutating operation (create, update, delete, rotate), confirm the new state:
- Re-run the corresponding `get` or `describe` command
- Confirm the output matches the user's intent
- Report the result

### Diagnosis path

#### Step 1: Identify the symptom

Ask the user for the exact, copy-pasted error text. Do not accept paraphrases — the exact string often encodes the layer (e.g., `x509:` prefix means TLS/cert layer, `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED:` prefix means gRPC rate limit, `NondeterminismError` means workflow replay layer). Note that `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` alone does not tell you which condition fired — account-limit throttling and per-Workflow lock contention (`Workflow is busy`, i.e. BusyWorkflow) share the code. Split the resource-exhausted metric by its label (`operation` on the Cloud v1 family, `resource_exhausted_cause` on v0 and self-hosted) rather than parsing the free-text message.

Confirm three things before continuing:
- What command was run, or what SDK call produced the error?
- What environment produced it (local dev server, self-hosted cluster, Temporal Cloud)? If clear from context (addresses, commands, namespace format), don't ask — **but if uncertain, ask now before proceeding with any diagnosis.** Save the answer to memory for future conversations.
- What changed recently (new deploy, new certs, new namespace, new region)?

#### Step 2: Gather context

The context the investigation needs depends on the category. At minimum:

- **For any Cloud auth / connectivity issue:** auth method (API key vs mTLS), exact address, exact namespace, SDK + version. The endpoint family differs by auth method — see [connectivity.md#endpoint-formats](references/triage/connectivity.md#endpoint-formats). For private connectivity (PrivateLink / PSC), TLS server name overrides also vary by auth method — see [cloud-connectivity.md](references/ops/cloud-connectivity.md).
- **For a stuck workflow:** namespace, workflow ID, run ID, and the output of `temporal workflow describe --workflow-id <id>` (pending-operation state lives here, not in the Event History alone). Event History via `temporal workflow show` is the companion view.
- **For a worker health issue:** worker logs (registration errors, auth errors, panics), the output of `temporal task-queue describe --task-queue <q>`, and `temporal worker describe --task-queue <q>` for per-worker details.
- **For a non-determinism error:** the worker log line containing the error, the workflow type name, and access to the history JSON for replay.

#### Step 3: Validate pasted SDK config (if any)

If the user has pasted SDK connection code — even just the address/namespace/auth fields — review it against [sdk-snippet-review.md](references/triage/sdk-snippet-review.md) **before** descending the ladder. Wrong endpoint family, short namespace, or mismatched auth method will make every network-layer probe below look broken when nothing lower actually is.

Skip this step when the user has an established, previously-working config and the symptom is new — the snippet is not the culprit, the environment changed. Otherwise treat snippet validation as Layer 0.

#### Step 4: Descend the ladder

Use [diagnostic-ladder.md](references/triage/diagnostic-ladder.md) to pick the right starting layer. As a rule of thumb:

- Auth / connectivity / cert symptom → start at layer 1 (DNS) and walk up.
- Worker / task-queue symptom → start at layer 6 (namespace + pollers).
- Stuck workflow / determinism symptom → start at layer 7 (workflow code), but confirm layer 6 (worker is actually polling) first.

Each layer has a command that proves it healthy and a failure signature that tells you whether the problem lives at that layer or higher.

#### Step 5: Fix and verify

Prescribe the fix scoped to the root cause. Then verify by re-running the layer's healthy-check command and, if possible, the original user operation. Attach the confidence score to the diagnosis.

If the layer above the fix is still failing, return to step 4 and continue walking upward — the first broken layer is rarely the only one.

## Prerequisites

- **Temporal CLI** (`temporal`) — required for data-plane operations and self-hosted admin. Install: `brew install temporal` or see [Temporal CLI docs](https://docs.temporal.io/cli).
- **tcld** — required for Cloud operations. Install: `brew install temporal-cloud-cli` or see [tcld docs](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld). Authenticate with `tcld login` before use.

- [rate-limits.md](references/triage/rate-limits.md) — what `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` means (and does not), Cloud APS / RPS / OPS under On-Demand and Provisioned capacity modes, self-hosted `frontend.rps` / `frontend.namespaceRPS` dynamic config, identifying which limit fired via the throttle metrics (Cloud v1) or the `resource_exhausted_cause` label (v0 / self-hosted), and separating account-limit throttling from single-resource exhaustion.
- [ha-failover.md](references/triage/ha-failover.md) — Cloud HA routing via the Namespace Endpoint CNAME, verifying the active region (control-plane `tcld namespace get` vs. DNS view), clients that did not follow the failover, PrivateLink after failover, failover-not-executing, handover-window errors, platform limits, RPO/RTO semantics, and Serverless Workers (AWS Lambda) not following a failover because compute-provider configuration is region-scoped.
- [runtime-errors.md](references/triage/runtime-errors.md) — deadline-exceeded disambiguated by operation and by where the call was made, Workflow lock contention (BusyWorkflow) separated from account-limit throttling and confirmed via the `operation` breakdown, routing for `no pollers` / `INVALID_ARGUMENT` / unspecified `UNAVAILABLE`.
- [replay.md](references/triage/replay.md) — fetching Event History with the SDK client (CLI export as fallback), running the SDK replayer in every supported SDK (Go, Python, TypeScript, Java, .NET, Ruby, PHP), `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` and the deadlock detector, interpreting divergent and successful replays, and the TypeScript-only VS Code extension.
- [blob-size-limits.md](references/triage/blob-size-limits.md) — Payload size limit (2 MB) and gRPC message size limit (4 MB): error messages, per-SDK behavior (Python 1.23.0+ vs. others), claim check pattern, External Storage (Pre-release), batch-size reduction.
- [performance-bottlenecks.md](references/triage/performance-bottlenecks.md) — Latency and throughput diagnosis via SDK metrics: schedule-to-start latency, workflow task execution latency, replay latency, activity execution latency, task slot depletion, network request metrics, sticky cache metrics.
- [schedule-missed.md](references/triage/schedule-missed.md) — Missed Schedule Actions: alerting via `temporal_cloud_v1_schedule_missed_catchup_window_count` / `schedule_missed_catchup_window`, investigation via `temporal schedule list` + `temporal schedule describe`, DescribeSchedule fields (`missedCatchupWindow`, `overlapSkipped`, `bufferDropped`), default catchup window (one year), root causes, overlap policies (6 values), backfill remediation.
- [recipes.md](references/triage/recipes.md) — four end-to-end triage walkthroughs: stuck workflow at 3am, cert expired with workers offline, task-queue backlog mystery, non-determinism caught in prod.


## Reporting Issues in This Skill
