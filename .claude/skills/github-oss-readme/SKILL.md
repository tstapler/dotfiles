# github-oss-readme

Forked from [adewale/good-readme](https://github.com/adewale/good-readme) (MIT) and extended to cover a repo's broader open-source "credentials" — not just the README, but the community-health files GitHub itself checks for (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, issue/PR templates).

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: A README is the front door to your project. It should answer "what is this, why should I care, and how do I use it?" within 30 seconds. Every section earns its place by serving a reader's real need — don't pad with boilerplate.

**Good READMEs** are scannable, honest, and audience-aware. They lead with a clear value proposition, show real usage examples, and respect the reader's time. A developer evaluating your project will decide in under a minute whether to invest further — the README is your pitch.

**Bad READMEs** are walls of text with no structure, auto-generated boilerplate nobody reads, or sparse one-liners that force readers to dig through source code. Equally bad: over-documented READMEs that duplicate what's in `/docs` or include every API method inline.

A repo's **open-source credentials** are the signals beyond the README that tell a visitor (and GitHub's own "Community Standards" checklist) this project is a legitimate, safe, and maintained place to contribute: a LICENSE, a CONTRIBUTING guide, a CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and issue/PR templates. Missing these doesn't just look incomplete — it actively discourages contribution and, for a LICENSE, leaves the legal terms of use undefined.

See [anatomy.md](references/anatomy.md) for section-by-section README guidance, [examples.md](references/examples.md) for patterns from well-regarded projects, [anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) for common README mistakes, and [oss-credentials.md](references/oss-credentials.md) for the community-health file checklist.

## Modes

This skill operates in three modes:

### 1. Create — New README

For projects that have no README or need one written from scratch.

**Before writing anything:**

- [ ] Read the project's source code to understand what it does
- [ ] Identify the target audience (end users, developers, both?)
- [ ] Check for existing docs, config files, and CI setup that reveal project conventions
- [ ] Look at package.json / Cargo.toml / pyproject.toml / go.mod etc. for project metadata
- [ ] Build a source-grounded facts list: package name, entrypoints, exported functions/classes, CLI commands/flags, config keys, and required runtime versions
- [ ] For every API, command, or import you plan to document, verify it against current source or manifests before naming it
- [ ] Ask the user: "Who is this README for, and what's the one thing you want them to understand?"

**Writing process:**

- [ ] Draft the title + one-line description (the hook)
- [ ] Write a concise "What & Why" section (2-4 sentences max)
- [ ] Add a quick-start that gets the reader from zero to working in minimal steps
- [ ] Include real, tested code examples — not pseudocode
- [ ] Add installation instructions appropriate to the ecosystem
- [ ] Only add sections that this specific project needs (see [anatomy.md](references/anatomy.md))
- [ ] Present draft to user for review before finalizing

### 2. Improve — Existing README

For projects with a README that needs enhancement.

**Audit first:**

- [ ] Read the current README completely
- [ ] Read the project source to check if README is accurate and current
- [ ] Run an API/CLI drift pass: extract README imports, functions, commands, flags, and config keys; compare each one to current public exports, entrypoints, and schemas
- [ ] Score against the [quality checklist](references/quality-checklist.md)
- [ ] Identify gaps, outdated content, unnecessary sections, and source-backed drift
- [ ] Present findings to user with specific recommendations and the source files/manifests that justify factual corrections

**Then improve:**

- [ ] Fix factual inaccuracies first (wrong install commands, outdated API examples), citing the source file or manifest that proves the correction
- [ ] Address structural issues (missing sections, poor ordering)
- [ ] Improve clarity and scannability (headers, code blocks, lists)
- [ ] Remove boilerplate that adds no value
- [ ] Rewrite stale examples with current imports, functions, signatures, and commands only after confirming they are exported or defined; do not invent compatibility wrappers for missing names
- [ ] Verify all code examples work, or state which checks could not be run
- [ ] Present changes to user for approval

### 3. Credentials audit — Community-health files

For checking or scaffolding the files GitHub's own "Community Standards" checklist (repo Insights → Community) looks for. See [oss-credentials.md](references/oss-credentials.md) for the full checklist, license-choice guidance, and file templates.

- [ ] Check for `LICENSE`/`LICENSE.md` at repo root; if missing, ask the user which license they want (default suggestion: MIT for a small tool, Apache-2.0 if patent grant matters) — never choose or invent license text unasked
- [ ] Check for `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing how to file issues, run tests, and submit PRs
- [ ] Check for `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant is the common default)
- [ ] Check for `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- [ ] Check for a `SECURITY.md` if the project accepts vulnerability reports
- [ ] Cross-check the README's own "Contributing" and "License" sections point at these files rather than duplicating their content
- [ ] Present a gap list to the user before creating any file — these are policy documents, not boilerplate to drop in silently

## Key Principles

1. **Lead with value** — The first 3 lines determine if someone keeps reading
2. **Show, don't tell** — Code examples > prose descriptions
3. **Be honest about scope** — State what the project does AND what it doesn't do
4. **Respect ecosystem conventions** — npm projects look different from Rust crates
5. **Keep it maintained** — A README that lies is worse than no README
6. **Link, don't duplicate** — Point to docs/ for deep dives, keep the README focused
7. **Test your examples** — Broken code examples destroy trust instantly
8. **Source beats memory** — Treat README examples, previous docs, and model memory as suspect until checked against current source and manifests
9. **Never invent legal text** — A LICENSE or CODE_OF_CONDUCT is a policy decision; confirm the choice with the user before writing one

## Source-Grounded API Drift Protocol

Use this protocol whenever a README mentions functions, classes, imports, CLI commands, flags, config keys, or examples that may have drifted from the code.

1. **Extract documented symbols** — List every README import, public API name, command, flag, option, and config key before editing.
2. **Find authoritative definitions** — Check package manifests (`exports`, `bin`, entrypoints), public export files (`__init__.py`, `index.ts`, `lib.rs`, `go.mod` module path), CLI parsers, config schemas, and type declarations.
3. **Confirm existence and signature** — Search for definitions, not just string occurrences. Verify import paths, parameter names, required options, return/output shape, and deprecation notes.
4. **Classify drift explicitly** — Mark each mismatch as renamed, removed, moved, changed signature, undocumented, or ambiguous. Include source file evidence such as `src/package/__init__.py` or `package.json#bin`.
5. **Rewrite from source, not guesses** — Replace stale examples with the current exported API. Mention the old name only as a drift/migration note; never present it as current unless source proves compatibility.
6. **Handle uncertainty honestly** — If source does not reveal the replacement, say so and ask the user or leave a placeholder note for maintainers. Do not hallucinate a wrapper, alias, benchmark, compatibility claim, or implementation.
7. **Verify the corrected snippet** — Run the documented command/example when feasible. If not, state the exact verification not run.

When reporting an audit, include a compact "Source checked" note or table for API drift findings: stale README symbol, current source symbol, evidence file, and corrected snippet.

## Per-Section Checklist

```
[ ] Title is clear and descriptive (not clever)
[ ] One-liner explains what + why in plain language
[ ] Quick-start gets reader to "it works" in ≤5 steps
[ ] Code examples are real, tested, and copy-pasteable
[ ] Installation covers the project's actual ecosystem
[ ] No orphan sections (every section serves a purpose)
[ ] Badges are useful, not decorative
[ ] License is stated
[ ] Contributing section exists if accepting contributions
```
