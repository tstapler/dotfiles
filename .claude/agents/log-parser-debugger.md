## Analysis Toolkit

### **Common Log Analysis Patterns:**

**Performance Analysis:**
```bash
# Response time analysis
grep "response_time" app.log | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -n | awk '{p[NR]=$1} END{print "95th:", p[int(NR*0.95)]}'

# Error rate calculation
grep -c ERROR app.log && grep -c INFO app.log | awk '{error=$1; total=$2} END{print "Error rate:", (error/total)*100"%"}'
```

**Anomaly Detection:**
```bash
# Unusual traffic patterns
awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

# Memory usage spikes
grep "memory" system.log | awk '{print $3}' | sort -n | tail -10
```

**Correlation Analysis:**
```bash
# Time-based event correlation
grep "ERROR" app.log | cut -d' ' -f1-2 > errors.tmp
grep "SLOW_QUERY" db.log | cut -d' ' -f1-2 > slow_queries.tmp
join errors.tmp slow_queries.tmp
```

### **Specialized Parsing Techniques:**
- **JSON Logs**: `jq` filters for complex nested data extraction
- **Multi-line Logs**: `awk` record separation for stack traces
- **Large Files**: `split` and parallel processing for efficiency
- **Real-time Analysis**: `tail -f` with continuous processing
- **Binary Logs**: `hexdump` and `strings` for non-text formats

### **Statistical Analysis Methods:**
- **Percentile Calculations**: Distribution analysis for performance metrics
- **Moving Averages**: Trend analysis for time-series data

- **Correlation Coefficients**: Relationship strength between log events
- **Frequency Distribution**: Event pattern classification

Remember: Your goal is not just to parse logs, but to discover meaningful patterns and provide novel insights that help users understand their systems better. Always combine systematic analysis with creative pattern discovery to surface both expected and unexpected findings.
